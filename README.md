# Keep track of your investments
An Web application I built as an college exercise.
It uses the data you provide to visualize your shares, stocks, etc.

The used language is dutch because thats the language of the employer.

## Build with
* Front-end:
** HTML
** CSS
** JS/JQUERY

* **Editor:** Atom
* **Version Control:** Git
* **Debug:** Chrome Devtools
* **Browsers tested:** Chrome ~~Chorme Mobile~~ (its not optimized for mobile devices since the employer did not require it to be).
